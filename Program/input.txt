partNum = 2,        ! number of particles
dt = 0.001,         ! time step
time = 5.0			! total time
LX = 10,            ! box size x direction
LY = 10,            ! box size y direction
KK = 6000,          ! Strength of repulsive wall force
EPS = 1,            ! Strength of particle particle interaction
EPP = 30,           ! Initial energy per particle when using random start locations, no kinetic energy will exceed this value.
trace = 1,          ! Set 1 to get a dat file that plots the trajectory of particle number 1
animate = 0,        ! Set 1 to get a dat file friendly to animation using gnuplot
totE = 1,           ! Set 1 to get a dat file with the total energy
avgK = 0,           ! Set 1 to get a dat file with the time average kinetic energy of each particle
calibrate = 0,      ! Set to 1 to be able to manually change the intitial conditions
totalrand = 1,      ! Set to get random seed
distr = 0,          ! Number of particles that the initial energy is distributed amongst, set to 0 to distribute to all particles.
maxBoltz = 0,       ! Numerically calculate the probability distribution
hcp = 0             ! Set to 1 to get 19 particles in a hexagonal packing, this overrides several inputs.
